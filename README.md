# 🌍 World Bank Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This repository contains my **fourth Power BI project**, where I analyzed **real-world development data** downloaded from the **World Bank Open Data Catalog**. This project was a highly valuable learning experience that involved working with large, messy datasets, transforming them using Power Query, and building an interactive dashboard that highlights global development insights.

## 📊 Dashboard Description

### 💡 Dashboard Title: **World Bank Data Analysis**

This dashboard consists of **7 key visual sections**:

1. **📈 Top 5 Economies of the World**  
   - *Clustered Bar Chart* showing GDP comparison  
   - Countries: United States, China, Germany, Japan, India

2. **📊 Population Division as per Income Category**  
   - *Donut Chart* displaying income-based population split  
   - Categories: High income, Upper-middle income, Lower-middle income, Low income

3. **🌐 Income Categorization Map**  
   - *Filled Map* showing countries colored by income group  
   - Region-based geographical insights (Africa, Asia, Europe, etc.)
   - To enhance interactivity, I applied a **slicer** to the map visual that allows users to filter countries based on their **income category**.  
This feature makes it easy to explore how different income groups are distributed globally.  
Users can select from categories such as **High income**, **Upper middle income**, **Lower middle income**, and **Low income**.  
The map updates dynamically, helping users visually identify income-based regional patterns across the world.


4. **👥 World Population KPI**  
   - *Card visual* displaying the global population (8.11 billion)

5. **🏦 Lending Category Division**  
   - *Pie Chart* showing the distribution among lending categories (IBRD, IDA, Blend, No)

6. **📊 Top Populated Countries**  
   - *Bar Chart* comparing population of top 5 countries  
   - India, China, United States, Indonesia, Pakistan

7. **🌍 Region-wise Income Division**  
   - *Stacked Column Chart* showing income group split across global regions  
   - Regions: Europe & Central Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, etc.

## 🔧 Data Cleaning & Modeling

- Transformed data using **Power Query Editor**
- Removed nulls, reshaped columns, renamed headers
- Joined related tables (e.g., Income Groups, Population Data, Lending Categories)
- Created clean data models for each visual group
